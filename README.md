# Herd Immunity

## What is the project?
My goal is to create a simulation of a virus through a network of people. This will work by creating a population using a network graph and giving the virus to a number of people. Then I will have people in my population interact with people they know and possibly spread the virus.

## How can graph theory concepts be applied?
I can find out/predict the path to get someone sick using BFS
I can find the most vulnerable person in the population (using dynamic programming)
I can find out/predict the likelyhood of someone getting infected based on their distance from an infected person BFS
I can find out if one person has another person in their extended network that is infected DFS
